# INCIDENT-3 EXECUTION REPORT
## Payment Transaction Failure - October 30, 2025

**Incident ID**: INCIDENT-3-PAYMENT-FAILURE  
**Execution Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Execution Time**: 08:24:46 - 08:28:32 UTC  
**Duration**: ~4 minutes  
**Severity**: P1 - Critical  
**Operator**: parvaiz

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully simulated a **distributed transaction failure** in the Sock Shop microservices application by scaling the payment service to 0 replicas. During the 4-minute incident window, **5 orders failed** with `PAYMENT_FAILED` status due to payment service unavailability, while the UI incorrectly displayed them as "Shipped" due to caching issues.

### Impact Assessment
- **Total Orders Attempted**: 5
- **Failed Orders**: 5 (100% failure rate during outage)
- **Customers Affected**: 2 users (Rayaan, parvaiz)
- **Revenue at Risk**: $374.21
- **System Behavior**: Orders created but payment processing failed
- **User Experience**: No error messages displayed (critical UX issue)

## üîß ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Immediate Cause
Payment service deployment scaled to 0 replicas, simulating total service unavailability.

### Technical Details
1. **Service Failure**: Payment pods terminated, resulting in DNS resolution succeeding but connection being refused (Connection refused to 10.96.100.12:80)
2. **Order Service Behavior**: Orders service correctly:
   - Created orders with CREATED status
   - Transitioned to PENDING status
   - Attempted payment authorization via HTTP POST to `http://payment:80/paymentAuth`
   - Received `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused`
   - Correctly updated orders to PAYMENT_FAILED status
   - Did NOT create shipments (shipment: null)

3. **Front-End Issue**: UI displayed orders as "Shipped" despite database showing PAYMENT_FAILED (caching/state management issue)

### Underlying Issues
1. **No Retry Logic**: Orders service doesn't retry failed payment calls
2. **No Circuit Breaker**: No protection against cascading failures
3. **Poor Error Propagation**: Users didn't see error messages about payment failure
4. **UI Caching**: Front-end displays incorrect status from cache
5. **No Idempotency**: No mechanism to safely retry payments
6. **No User Notification**: Customers not informed about payment failure

---

## üìà OBSERVABILITY VERIFICATION

### Kubernetes State
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods
# Payment pod count: 0 (expected: 1)
# All other pods: Running
```

### Database State
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders
# Total orders: 8
# PAYMENT_FAILED: 5 orders
# PAID: 2 orders (pre-incident)
# Old PAYMENT_FAILED: 1 order (from 05:14:24)
```

### Logs Evidence
Orders service logs show consistent pattern for each failure:
1. Order creation (CREATED status)
2. Status update to PENDING
3. Payment authorization attempt
4. Connection refused error
5. Status update to PAYMENT_FAILED

## üìä KEY DATADOG VISUALIZATIONS TO CREATE

### Dashboard 1: Incident Overview
Create a dashboard with:
1. Payment service pod count (timeseries)
2. Orders service error rate (timeseries)
3. Order status distribution (pie chart: PAID vs PAYMENT_FAILED)
4. Network connectivity to payment service (binary: up/down)

### Dashboard 2: Transaction Flow Health
1. Order creation rate (orders/minute)
2. Payment success rate (%)
3. Average order processing time
4. Failed transaction count

---

## üí° DATADOG BEST PRACTICES LEARNED

### 1. Service Tag Naming
- ‚úÖ Correct: `service:sock-shop-orders`
- ‚ùå Incorrect: `service:orders`
- **Lesson**: Always verify actual service tag names in facets

### 2. Log Level Parsing
- **Issue**: Datadog not parsing Spring Boot log format
- **Workaround**: Search by log message content, not status facets
- **Future**: Create custom log pipeline for Spring Boot format

### 3. Source of Truth
- **UI**: Can show cached/incorrect data
- **Database/API**: Always the source of truth
- **Datadog Logs**: Provides complete transaction timeline

### 4. Multi-Service Correlation
- Use order IDs to trace requests across services
- Search by specific order ID to see full lifecycle
- Identify bottlenecks and failure points

---

## üîß RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Step 1: Restore Payment Service (To Be Executed)
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop scale deployment payment --replicas=1
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods -l name=payment -w
```

**Expected**: Payment pod starts and reaches Running state

### Step 2: Verify Payment Service Health
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop run test-payment-health --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- curl -s http://payment:80/health
```

**Expected**: `{"health":[{"service":"payment","status":"OK",...}]}`

### Step 3: Test Successful Order
- Place a new order via UI
- Verify it completes successfully with PAID status
- Check shipment is created

### Step 4: Export Failed Orders
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | Out-File orders-backup.json
```

---

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Implement Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff retry for payment calls
2. **Add Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures with Hystrix/Resilience4j
3. **Fix UI Error Display**: Ensure users see payment errors immediately
4. **Fix UI Caching**: Update UI to fetch real-time order status

### Short-Term (High Priority)
1. **Idempotent Payments**: Add idempotency keys to prevent double charges
2. **Payment Queue**: Implement async payment processing with retry queue
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Add alerts for payment service availability
4. **User Notifications**: Email customers about payment failures

### Long-Term (Strategic)
1. **Saga Pattern**: Implement distributed transaction compensation
2. **Event Sourcing**: Maintain audit trail of all order state transitions
3. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Add webhook support for async payment status
4. **Datadog Log Pipeline**: Create custom parser for Spring Boot logs
