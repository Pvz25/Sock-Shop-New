# Incident 3: Payment Transaction Failure (Inconsistent State)

## Overview

**Incident Type:** Distributed Transaction Failure Leading to Data Inconsistency  
**Severity:** Critical (P1)  
**User Impact:** Payment processed but order shows as "Payment Pending" or "Failed"  
**Root Cause:** Payment service unavailability during checkout causes transaction state inconsistency

**✅ PREREQUISITE:** This incident leverages the newly implemented `OrderStatus` lifecycle in the orders service. Ensure you have deployed the v1.0-status-fix version with `CREATED`, `PENDING`, `PAID`, and `PAYMENT_FAILED` status support.

## Incident Description

This incident simulates a critical e-commerce scenario where:
1. User places an order and completes checkout
2. Payment service is temporarily unavailable or times out
3. Payment is debited from user's account (or payment gateway shows success)
4. Order service records the order as "Payment Failed" or "Pending"
5. User is confused and frustrated (money taken, no order confirmation)

This is one of the **most critical production issues** in e-commerce because it:
- Creates financial reconciliation problems
- Damages customer trust
- Requires manual intervention to resolve
- Can lead to double charges or lost revenue

**Business Impact:**
- Customer service tickets spike
- Chargebacks and refunds required
- Revenue leakage (orders marked failed but payment captured)
- Reputation damage

## Pre-Incident Checklist

### 1. Verify Application is Healthy

```powershell
# Check all pods are running
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods

# Expected Output: All pods 1/1 READY, Running
```

### 2. Verify Payment Service is Running

```powershell
# Check payment pod specifically
kubectl -n sock-shop get pod -l name=payment

# Expected Output:
# NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# payment-xxxxx              1/1     Running   0          30m
```

### 3. Test Normal Order Flow (Baseline)

```powershell
# Open the application
Start-Process http://localhost:2025

# Manually test an order:
# 1. Browse catalogue
# 2. Add item to cart
# 3. Login (username: user / password: password)
# 4. Go to checkout
# 5. Complete order

# Expected: Order success page with order ID
```

### 4. Capture Baseline Order Count

```powershell
# IMPORTANT: Orders pod does not have curl installed
# Use front-end pod to query orders service via internal service DNS

kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Measure-Object

# Expected Output:
# Count             : 12  (or current number of orders)
# Average           : 
# Sum               : 
# Maximum           : 
# Minimum           : 
# StandardDeviation : 
# Property          : 

# Note: Orders service runs on port 80 (NOT 8080)
# Note: Using front-end pod because orders pod lacks curl utility
```

### 5. Verify Datadog is Collecting Logs

```powershell
# Check Datadog agent (select node agent, not cluster agent)
$POD = kubectl -n datadog get pods -o json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty items | Where-Object { $_.metadata.name -like "datadog-agent-*" -and $_.metadata.name -notlike "*cluster-agent*" } | Select-Object -First 1 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty metadata | Select-Object -ExpandProperty name

kubectl -n datadog exec $POD -c agent -- agent status | Select-String -Pattern "LogsProcessed"

# Expected Output: LogsProcessed: [non-zero number]
```

---

## Incident Execution Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Payment Failure Mechanism

We will simulate payment service failure using one of three methods:

| Method | Technique | User Impact | Datadog Visibility |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **A** | Scale payment to 0 replicas | Immediate failure | Connection refused errors |
| **B** | Add network delay to payment | Timeout errors | Timeout warnings |
| **C** | Inject HTTP 500 errors | Service degradation | 500 status codes |

**Recommended:** Method A (most straightforward and realistic)

### Step 2: Create Incident - Scale Down Payment Service

```powershell
# Scale payment service to 0 replicas (simulate total failure)
kubectl -n sock-shop scale deployment payment --replicas=0

# Verify payment pods are terminated
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods -l name=payment
```

**Expected Output:**
```
deployment.apps/payment scaled
No resources found in sock-shop namespace.
```

### Step 3: Verify Payment Service is Down

```powershell
# Try to access payment health endpoint (should fail)
kubectl -n sock-shop run test-payment --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- curl -v http://payment:80/health

# Expected Output:
# curl: (6) Could not resolve host: payment
# OR
# curl: (7) Failed to connect to payment port 80: Connection refused

pod "test-payment" deleted
```

### Step 4: Attempt to Place Orders (Generate Failed Transactions)

Now we'll place orders while the payment service is down to create inconsistent states.

#### Option A: Manual Order Placement (Recommended for Demo)

```powershell
# Open application in browser
Start-Process http://localhost:2025

# Perform the following steps:
# 1. Login with test credentials:
#    - Username: user
#    - Password: password
#
# 2. Add items to cart:
#    - Click on any sock product
#    - Click "Add to cart"
#    - Repeat for 2-3 items
#
# 3. Go to checkout:
#    - Click cart icon
#    - Click "Proceed to checkout"
#
# 4. Fill shipping info:
#    - Address: 123 Main Street
#    - City: Springfield
#    - Postcode: 12345
#    - Country: USA
#
# 5. Click "Next" and then "Place Order"
```

**Expected User Experience:**
```
❌ Error: Unable to process payment
❌ Payment service unavailable
❌ Please try again later
```

**BUT:** In a real scenario, the payment gateway might have already charged the card!

#### Option B: Automated Order Placement via Locust (For Bulk Testing)

```powershell
cd d:\sock-shop-demo\load

# Create order placement test
@'
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: locustfile-payment-failure

        def on_start(self):
            """Login before placing orders"""
            self.client.post("/login", json={"username": "user", "password": "password"})
        
        @task
        def place_order_with_payment_failure(self):
            """Simulate full checkout flow"""
            # Add item to cart
            self.client.post("/cart", json={"id": f"item-{random.randint(1,100)}"})
            
            # Create order (this will fail due to payment service down)
            response = self.client.post("/orders", json={
                "customer": {"username": "user"},
                "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Springfield", "postcode": "12345", "country": "USA"},
                "card": {"longNum": "4111111111111111", "expires": "12/25", "ccv": "123"},
                "items": [{"itemId": f"item-{random.randint(1,10)}", "quantity": 1}]
            }, catch_response=True, name="Place Order (Payment Failing)")
            
            if response.status_code == 500 or "payment" in response.text.lower():
                # Expected failure - mark as success for test purposes
                response.success()
            elif response.status_code == 201:
                # Unexpected success (payment should be down!)
                response.failure("Order succeeded when payment should be down!")

kubectl apply -f .\locust-payment-failure.yaml
```

**Expected Output:**
```
configmap/locustfile-payment-failure created
job.batch/locust-payment-failure created
```

### Step 5: Monitor Failed Transactions

#### Monitor Orders Service Logs
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop logs -f deployment/orders
```

**Expected Log Patterns:**
```
INFO - Received order request from user: user
INFO - Creating order with ID: 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011
INFO - Order created with ID: 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011 and status: Created
INFO - Order 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011 status updated to PENDING
INFO - Calling payment service at http://payment:80/paymentAuth
ERROR - Payment service connection failed: Connection refused
ERROR - Unable to process payment for order 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011
INFO - Order 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011 status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED
INFO - Order 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011 saved with status: PAYMENT_FAILED
```

#### Monitor Front-end Logs
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop logs -f deployment/front-end
```

**Expected Log Patterns:**
```
POST /orders - Calling orders service
ERROR - Received 500 from orders service
ERROR - Payment processing failed: payment service unavailable
POST /orders - 500 - response_time: 5234ms
```

### Step 6: Investigate Order Status (Confirm Inconsistency)

```powershell
# Get all orders via front-end pod (orders pod doesn't have curl)
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Select-Object id, customerId, status, total, date | Format-Table -AutoSize

# Expected Output: Table showing all orders with their status
# id                       customerId               status          total        date
# --                       ----------               ------          -----        ----
# 6900953ac1f4320001b50703 69004a839c10d3000194fa98 PAYMENT_FAILED  104.979996   2025-10-28T10:04:42.603+0000
# 69009558c1f4320001b50704 69004a839c10d3000194fa98 PAYMENT_FAILED  19.99        2025-10-28T10:05:12.038+0000
# 69009581c1f4320001b50705 69004a839c10d3000194fa98 PAYMENT_FAILED  119.979996   2025-10-28T10:05:53.374+0000
# 69009589c1f4320001b50706 69004a839c10d3000194fa98 PAYMENT_FAILED  104.979996   2025-10-28T10:06:01.280+0000

# Filter for only failed orders:
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Where-Object { $_.status -eq "PAYMENT_FAILED" } | Select-Object id, status, total, date | Format-Table -AutoSize

# Note: Database name is 'data' (not 'orders'), collection is 'customerOrder'
# Note: Orders service internal DNS is 'orders' (not 'orders.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local' needed from front-end pod)
```

**Example Failed Order:**
```json
{
  "id": "68f35ed59c10d300018b7011",
  "customerId": "user",
  "status": "PAYMENT_FAILED",
  "shipment": null,
  "total": 29.99,
  "items": [
    {
      "itemId": "03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unitPrice": 17.99
    }
  ],
  "date": "2025-10-27T11:23:45.123Z"
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- ✅ `id`: Unique order ID created
- ❌ `status`: "PAYMENT_FAILED" (but user might have been charged!)
- ❌ `shipment`: null (order won't be fulfilled)

## Datadog Monitoring & Investigation

### 🔴 **CRITICAL: Datadog Service Tag & Log Level Parsing**

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES:**
1. ✅ **Service tag is `sock-shop-orders`** (NOT `orders`)
2. ⚠️ **Log level parsing issue**: Datadog is not parsing Spring Boot log format correctly
   - All logs show as `Info` in status facet
   - ERROR and WARN logs are ingested but not classified by status field
   - **Workaround**: Search by log MESSAGE content, not by status facets

### Step 1: Search for Failed Payment Transactions in Datadog Logs

**🔗 Datadog Logs Explorer:** https://us5.datadoghq.com/logs

**Time range:** Set to **Past 15 minutes** (or incident window)

**Search Query:**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders "Payment failed for order"
```

**Why this works:**
- Searches the raw log MESSAGE text (not parsed fields)
- Correctly identifies the service as `sock-shop-orders`
- Matches the exact error log pattern from OrdersController

**Expected Results:** 4 ERROR logs (from actual test execution)
```
2025-10-28 10:04:45.548 ERROR [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Payment failed for order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703: org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for "http://payment/paymentAuth": Connection refused (Connection refused); nested exception is java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)

2025-10-28 10:05:13.081 ERROR [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Payment failed for order 69009558c1f4320001b50704: org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for "http://payment/paymentAuth": Connection refused (Connection refused)

2025-10-28 10:05:54.512 ERROR [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Payment failed for order 69009581c1f4320001b50705: org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for "http://payment/paymentAuth": Connection refused (Connection refused)

2025-10-28 10:06:02.383 ERROR [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Payment failed for order 69009589c1f4320001b50706: org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for "http://payment/paymentAuth": Connection refused (Connection refused)
```

### Step 2: Search for Specific Order ID Timeline

**Search Query:**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop "6900953ac1f4320001b50703"
```

This shows the complete transaction flow across all services for the first failed order.

**Expected Log Timeline (from actual execution):**
```
Oct 28 15:34:43.913 [sock-shop-orders] INFO  - Order created with ID: 6900953ac1f4320001b50703 and status: Created
Oct 28 15:34:43.913 [sock-shop-orders] INFO  - Order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703 status updated to PENDING
Oct 28 15:34:43.913 [sock-shop-orders] INFO  - Sending payment request for order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703: PaymentRequest{...}
Oct 28 15:34:45.914 [sock-shop-orders] ERROR - Payment failed for order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703: org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for "http://payment/paymentAuth": Connection refused
Oct 28 15:34:45.914 [sock-shop-orders] WARN  - Order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703 status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED due to: Connection refused
Oct 28 15:34:46.915 [sock-shop-orders] ERROR - Servlet.service() threw exception: Payment service unavailable for order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703
Oct 28 15:34:47.818 [sock-shop-front-end] ERROR - Order response: {"statusCode":500,"error":"Internal Server Error","message":"Payment service unavailable for order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703"}
```

**Timeline Analysis:**
- `T+0s`: Order creation (CREATED status)
- `T+0.01s`: Status transition to PENDING
- `T+0.01s`: Payment authorization request sent
- `T+2s`: ERROR - Payment connection refused (service is down)
- `T+2.06s`: WARN - Order marked as PAYMENT_FAILED
- `T+3s`: ERROR - Exception propagated to servlet layer
- `T+4s`: Front-end receives 500 error response

### Step 3: Monitor Payment Service Downtime

**Search Query:**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-payment
```

**Expected Results:**
- **No logs during outage** (service is scaled to 0 replicas, pods terminated)
- Last logs before termination may show pod shutdown
- First logs after recovery show pod startup

**Alternative Query** (to confirm payment service was actually down):
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop pod_name:payment*
```

During the incident window (Oct 28 10:04 - 10:06), you should see NO payment pod logs.

### Step 4: Check for Connection Refused Errors

**Search Query:**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders "Connection refused"
```

**Expected Results:** 4 occurrences (one per failed order)

**Actual kubectl verification:**
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders | Select-String "Payment failed" | Measure-Object

# Output:
# Count             : 4
# Average           : 
# Sum               : 
# Maximum           : 
# Minimum           : 
# StandardDeviation : 
# Property          : 
```

**Alternative search** (broader scope):
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop "Connection refused" OR "Connection failed"
```

This captures connection errors across all services, not just orders.

### Step 5: Search for Order Status Updates

**Search Query** (find all PAYMENT_FAILED status updates):
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders "status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED"
```

**Expected Results:** 4 WARN logs
```
2025-10-28 10:04:45.607 WARN [orders,...] Order 6900953ac1f4320001b50703 status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED due to: Connection refused
2025-10-28 10:05:13.089 WARN [orders,...] Order 69009558c1f4320001b50704 status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED due to: Connection refused  
2025-10-28 10:05:54.520 WARN [orders,...] Order 69009581c1f4320001b50705 status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED due to: Connection refused
2025-10-28 10:06:02.391 WARN [orders,...] Order 69009589c1f4320001b50706 status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED due to: Connection refused
```

### Step 6: Verify Orders Service Logs in Datadog

**Search Query** (find order creation events):
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders "Order created with ID"
```

**Expected:** All orders, both successful and failed, will show creation logs

**Actual test results:** 9 INFO logs found (including 4 failed orders + 5 successful orders)

### Step 7: Create Datadog Incident Timeline (Optional)

**If using Datadog Incident Management:**

1. Go to: https://us5.datadoghq.com/incidents
2. Create new incident
3. **Title:** "Payment Service Failure - Order Transaction Inconsistency"
4. **Severity:** SEV-1 (Critical)
5. **Impact:** Customers unable to complete purchases, potential financial inconsistencies
6. **Timeline** (based on actual execution):
   - `Oct 28 10:04:00`: Payment service scaled to 0 replicas
   - `Oct 28 10:04:42`: First failed order detected (ID: 6900953ac1f4320001b50703)
   - `Oct 28 10:05:12`: Second failed order (ID: 69009558c1f4320001b50704)
   - `Oct 28 10:05:53`: Third failed order (ID: 69009581c1f4320001b50705)
   - `Oct 28 10:06:01`: Fourth failed order (ID: 69009589c1f4320001b50706)
   - `Oct 28 10:13:00`: Payment service restored to 1 replica
   - `Oct 28 10:14:14`: First successful order post-recovery (ID: 69009776c1f4320001b50707)

---

## Recovery Steps

### Step 1: Restore Payment Service

```powershell
# Scale payment service back to 1 replica
kubectl -n sock-shop scale deployment payment --replicas=1

# Wait for pod to start
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods -l name=payment -w
```

**Expected Output:**
```
deployment.apps/payment scaled

NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
payment-xxxxx              0/1     Pending   0          1s

```

Press `Ctrl+C` after pod shows `1/1 Running`.

### Step 2: Verify Payment Service Health

```powershell
# Test payment health endpoint (via service port 80)
kubectl -n sock-shop run test-payment-health --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- curl -s http://payment:80/health

# Expected Output (actual from test execution):
# {"health":[{"service":"payment","status":"OK","time":"2025-10-28 10:13:41.395245431 +0000 UTC m=+35.170731323"}]}
# pod "test-payment-health" deleted
```

**Verification via kubectl:**
```powershell
# Alternative: Check pod logs to verify payment service is processing requests
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/payment --tail=20

# Expected: Payment service startup logs and health check requests
```

### Step 3: Test Normal Order Flow (Verify Recovery)

```powershell
# Open application
Start-Process http://localhost:2025

# Place a test order (same steps as before):
# 1. Login (user/password)
# 2. Add item to cart
# 3. Checkout
# 4. Complete order

# Expected: ✅ Order Success Page
```

### Step 4: Identify Failed Orders Requiring Remediation

```powershell
# Query orders service for failed payment orders via front-end pod
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Where-Object { $_.status -eq "PAYMENT_FAILED" } | Select-Object id, status, total, date | Format-Table -AutoSize

# Expected Output: Table of failed orders
```

**Actual Output from Test Execution:**
```
id                       status          total        date
--                       ------          -----        ----
6900953ac1f4320001b50703 PAYMENT_FAILED  104.979996   2025-10-28T10:04:42.603+0000
69009558c1f4320001b50704 PAYMENT_FAILED  19.99        2025-10-28T10:05:12.038+0000
69009581c1f4320001b50705 PAYMENT_FAILED  119.979996   2025-10-28T10:05:53.374+0000
69009589c1f4320001b50706 PAYMENT_FAILED  104.979996   2025-10-28T10:06:01.280+0000
```

**Count failed orders:**
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Where-Object { $_.status -eq "PAYMENT_FAILED" } | Measure-Object

# Output:
# Count: 4
```

**Alternative: Check via kubectl logs:**
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders | Select-String "status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED"

# Shows all PAYMENT_FAILED status updates with order IDs
```

### Step 5: Manual Remediation (Production Scenario)

In a real production scenario, SRE/Support team would need to:

1. **Verify with Payment Gateway:**
   - Check if payment was actually processed
   - Review transaction logs in Stripe/PayPal/etc.

2. **For Each Failed Order:**
   - **If payment was captured:** Manually mark order as PAID and trigger fulfillment
   - **If payment was NOT captured:** Notify customer and request re-order

3. **Communication:**
   - Email affected customers
   - Apologize for inconvenience
   - Provide resolution (order being processed OR refund issued)

**For this demo environment**, we'll document the failed orders without remediation:

```powershell
# Export failed orders for review
$TIMESTAMP = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss"

kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Where-Object { $_.status -eq "PAYMENT_FAILED" } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 "D:\sock-shop-demo\incident3-failed-orders-$TIMESTAMP.json"

Write-Host "================================================" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Failed orders exported to:" -ForegroundColor Green  
Write-Host "D:\sock-shop-demo\incident3-failed-orders-$TIMESTAMP.json" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "================================================" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "In production, these would require manual reconciliation with payment gateway." -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

**Expected Output:**
```
================================================
Failed orders exported to:
D:\sock-shop-demo\incident3-failed-orders-20251028-101500.json
================================================
In production, these would require manual reconciliation with payment gateway.
```

### Step 6: Clean Up Test Resources

```powershell
# If you used Locust
kubectl -n sock-shop delete job locust-payment-failure
kubectl -n sock-shop delete configmap locustfile-payment-failure

# Verify cleanup
kubectl -n sock-shop get job,configmap | Select-String locust
```

**Expected Output:** No locust-related resources

### Step 7: Verify Datadog Shows Recovery

**🔗 Datadog Logs:** https://us5.datadoghq.com/logs

**Search Query:**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-payment
```

**Expected Log Patterns (Recovered):**
- Payment service startup logs
- Health check responses
- Ready to process payment requests

**Verify successful order post-recovery:**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders "69009776c1f4320001b50707"
```

**Expected (actual from test execution):**
```
2025-10-28 10:14:15.068 INFO  [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Order created with ID: 69009776c1f4320001b50707 and status: Created
2025-10-28 10:14:15.078 INFO  [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Order 69009776c1f4320001b50707 status updated to PENDING
2025-10-28 10:14:15.079 INFO  [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Sending payment request for order 69009776c1f4320001b50707: PaymentRequest{...}
2025-10-28 10:14:15.177 INFO  [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Received payment response for order 69009776c1f4320001b50707: PaymentResponse{authorised=true, message=Payment authorised}
2025-10-28 10:14:15.181 INFO  [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Order 69009776c1f4320001b50707 payment successful, status updated to PAID
2025-10-28 10:14:16.590 INFO  [orders,...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Order 69009776c1f4320001b50707 shipped successfully
```

**Key Indicators of Recovery:**
- ✅ No "Connection refused" errors
- ✅ PaymentResponse shows `authorised=true`
- ✅ Order progresses through full lifecycle: CREATED → PENDING → PAID → SHIPPED
- ✅ Shipment object is NOT null

**Compare with kubectl:**
```powershell
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders | Select-String "69009776c1f4320001b50707"

# Shows same successful order flow
```

## Post-Incident Analysis

### Incident Summary

**Duration:** ~10 minutes (payment down + restoration)  
**Affected Orders:** Variable (depends on test volume)  
**Financial Impact:** Potential double charges or lost revenue  
**User Impact:** Frustrated customers, support tickets, trust damage  
**Technical Root Cause:** Payment service unavailability during transaction processing

### Root Cause Deep Dive

**Immediate Cause:** Payment deployment scaled to 0 replicas (simulating service failure)

**Underlying Issues:**
1. **No retry logic:** Orders service doesn't retry payment calls
2. **No circuit breaker:** Failed payment calls cause cascading failures
3. **No idempotency:** No mechanism to safely retry payment operations
4. **No compensation logic:** Failed transactions aren't automatically reversed/retried
5. **Poor error handling:** User sees generic error, not actionable message

### Evidence Collected

**From Logs:**
```
ERROR - Payment service connection failed: Connection refused
INFO - Order 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011 status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED
```

**From Metrics:**
```
Payment service replicas: 0
Orders service error rate: 100% for payment calls
Failed order count: X
```

**From Application:**
```
User sees: "Payment failed" error
Order status: PAYMENT_FAILED
```

### Business Impact Assessment

| Impact Area | Severity | Mitigation Needed |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Customer Experience | High | Proactive communication |
| Financial Reconciliation | Critical | Manual review of all transactions |
| Support Load | High | Prepare support scripts/FAQs |
| Reputation | Medium | Social media monitoring |

---

## Recommended Remediation (For Production)

### Immediate (Prevent Future Occurrences)

**1. Implement Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
```java
// In Orders service
@Retryable(
    value = {PaymentServiceException.class},
    maxAttempts = 3,
    backoff = @Backoff(delay = 1000, multiplier = 2)
)
public PaymentResponse processPayment(Order order) {
    return paymentClient.authorizePayment(order);
}
```

**2. Add Circuit Breaker**
```java
@CircuitBreaker(
    name = "payment-service",
    fallbackMethod = "paymentFallback"
)
public PaymentResponse processPayment(Order order) {
    return paymentClient.authorizePayment(order);
}

private PaymentResponse paymentFallback(Order order, Exception ex) {
    // Mark order as PAYMENT_PENDING instead of FAILED
    // Queue for retry after service recovery
    return new PaymentResponse(PaymentStatus.PENDING);
}
```

**3. Implement Idempotent Payment Operations**
```java
// Add idempotency key to payment requests
String idempotencyKey = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
PaymentRequest request = PaymentRequest.builder()
    .orderId(order.getId())
    .amount(order.getTotal())
    .idempotencyKey(idempotencyKey)  // Prevents double charges
    .build();
```

### Short-Term

**1. Add Payment Service Monitoring**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: payment-service-alerts
spec:
  groups:
    - name: payment
      rules:
        - alert: PaymentServiceDown
          expr: up{job="payment"} == 0
          for: 1m
          labels:
            severity: critical
          annotations:
            summary: "Payment service is down"
            description: "Critical: Payment service unavailable for 1+ minutes"
```

**2. Implement Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions**
- Use compensating transactions for rollback
- Implement event sourcing for transaction audit trail

**3. Add Health Check Dependencies**
```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/dependencies
    port: 80  # Updated to match actual orders service port
  # Only mark orders service Ready if payment service is reachable
```

### Long-Term

**1. Implement Event-Driven Architecture**
- Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for async payment processing
- Decouple order creation from payment processing

**2. Add Payment Queue with Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**
- Failed payments go to DLQ for manual review
- Automatic retry with configurable delays

**3. Financial Reconciliation Dashboard**
- Daily report of orders vs. payment gateway transactions
- Automated detection of discrepancies

---

## Expected Outcomes

### During Incident
✅ Payment service scaled to 0 replicas  
✅ Orders fail with "payment service unavailable"  
✅ Orders marked as "PAYMENT_FAILED" in database  
✅ Datadog logs show connection refused errors  
✅ Users see payment error message  
✅ No successful orders processed

### After Recovery
✅ Payment service restored (1/1 Running)  
✅ Payment health check passes  
✅ New orders process successfully  
✅ Datadog logs show successful payments  
✅ Failed orders identified and documented  
✅ (Production) Failed orders manually reconciled

---

## SRE Agent Testing Scenarios

This incident is ideal for testing SRE agent capabilities:

### Investigation Prompts

**Prompt 1:** "Users are reporting that their payment was charged but they didn't receive order confirmation. Can you investigate order ID: 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011?"

**Expected Agent Actions:**
1. Query Datadog logs for order ID
2. Identify "PAYMENT_FAILED" status
3. Find connection refused errors to payment service
4. Check payment service availability (0 replicas)
5. Recommend: Restore payment service, verify actual payment status with gateway

**Prompt 2:** "What happened between 11:20 and 11:30 that caused order failures?"

**Expected Agent Actions:**
1. Query Datadog for errors in that timeframe
2. Identify spike in payment connection errors
3. Correlate with payment service downtime
4. Generate incident timeline
5. Recommend: Implement retry logic and circuit breakers

**Prompt 3:** "How many orders are in PAYMENT_FAILED status? What should we do?"

**Expected Agent Actions:**
1. Query orders database or logs
2. Count failed orders
3. Recommend verification with payment gateway
4. Suggest customer communication plan
5. Propose technical fixes (retry logic, saga pattern)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: UI Shows "Shipped" but Database Shows "PAYMENT_FAILED"

**Symptom:** UI displays orders as "Shipped" even though database has `status: PAYMENT_FAILED`

**Root Cause:** UI caching or stale data in front-end application

**Verification:**
```powershell
# Check actual database status via API
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Where-Object { $_.id -eq "6900953ac1f4320001b50703" } | Select-Object id, status

# Expected:
# id                       status
# --                       ------
# 6900953ac1f4320001b50703 PAYMENT_FAILED
```

**Solution:**
1. **Hard refresh browser:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`
2. **Clear browser cache** and reload
3. **Query API directly** to confirm database state (as shown above)
4. **Check front-end logs** for any errors:
   ```powershell
   kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/front-end | Select-String "order"
   ```

**Note:** The database is the source of truth. Always verify order status via API, not just UI.

### Issue 2: Datadog Shows All Logs as "Info" Status

**Symptom:** Datadog status facet shows 537 Info logs, 0 Error logs, 0 Warn logs (but errors clearly exist)

**Root Cause:** Datadog is not parsing Spring Boot log format correctly. The log format is:
```
2025-10-28 10:04:45.548 ERROR [orders,...] 1 --- [...] w.w.s.o.controllers.OrdersController : Message
```

Datadog needs a custom log pipeline to extract the log level from this format.

**Workaround:**
```
# DON'T use status facets:
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders status:error  # ❌ Returns 0 results

# DO search by message content:
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders "ERROR"  # ✅ Returns actual ERROR logs
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders "Payment failed"  # ✅ Returns payment errors
```

**Permanent Fix (Optional):**
Create a Datadog log pipeline to parse Spring Boot format:
1. Go to https://us5.datadoghq.com/logs/pipelines
2. Create new pipeline for `service:sock-shop-orders`
3. Add Grok Parser:
   ```
   %{date("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"):timestamp}\s+%{word:level}\s+\[%{notSpace:service},%{notSpace:trace_id},%{notSpace:span_id},%{notSpace:trace_sampled}\]\s+%{number:thread_id}\s+---\s+\[%{notSpace:thread_name}\]\s+%{notSpace:logger_name}\s+:\s+%{data:message}
   ```
4. Add Status Remapper to map `level` field to `status`

### Issue 3: Orders Still Succeeding After Scaling Payment to 0

**Cause:** May be caching or mock payment in dev mode.

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Verify payment pod is really gone
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods -l name=payment

# Check orders service logs to confirm it's trying to call payment
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders | Select-String -Pattern "payment"
```

### Issue 4: Can't Query Orders Service (curl not found)

**Symptom:** `kubectl exec deployment/orders -- curl` fails with "curl: not found"

**Root Cause:** Orders pod doesn't have curl utility installed

**Solution:** Use front-end pod instead (it has curl):
```powershell
# ❌ DON'T use orders pod:
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/orders -- curl http://localhost:80/orders

# ✅ DO use front-end pod:
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders
```

### Issue 5: Can't Find Failed Orders in Database

**Cause:** Order creation might fail before persisting to database.

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check orders service logs directly
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders | Select-String -Pattern "PAYMENT_FAILED"

# Verify orders were actually created:
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders | Select-String -Pattern "Order created with ID"

# Query via front-end pod:
kubectl -n sock-shop exec -it deployment/front-end -- curl -s http://orders:80/orders | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty _embedded | Select-Object -ExpandProperty customerOrders | Where-Object { $_.status -eq "PAYMENT_FAILED" }
```

### Issue 6: Payment Service Won't Start After Scaling Back Up

**Cause:** Image pull issues or resource constraints.

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Describe pod to see events
kubectl -n sock-shop describe pod -l name=payment

# Check pod events
kubectl -n sock-shop get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | Select-String "payment"

# Check node resources
kubectl top nodes

# Check if image exists
kubectl -n sock-shop get pod -l name=payment -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.containerStatuses[0].imageID}'
```

### Issue 7: Datadog Not Showing Any Logs for Orders Service

**Symptom:** Datadog search returns 0 results

**Root Cause:** Using wrong service tag name

**Solution:**
```powershell
# ❌ WRONG service tag:
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:orders

# ✅ CORRECT service tag:
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders
```

**Verification:**
In Datadog Logs Explorer, filter by `kube_namespace:sock-shop` and check the **Service** facet on the left sidebar. You should see:
- `sock-shop-orders` ✅
- `sock-shop-front-end` ✅
- `sock-shop-payment` ✅
- `sock-shop-shipping` ✅
- etc.

**NOT** just `orders`, `front-end`, `payment`

## Summary

This incident demonstrates one of the most challenging production scenarios: **distributed transaction failures** leading to inconsistent state across microservices. Unlike crashes or latency issues, this creates:

1. **Silent failures:** System appears to work but creates wrong data
2. **Financial impact:** Real money involved, not just performance
3. **Complex remediation:** Requires manual investigation and reconciliation
4. **Trust damage:** Users lose confidence in the platform

The Datadog integration provides critical capabilities for:
- **Transaction tracing:** Following order ID through all services
- **Correlation:** Linking order failures to payment service downtime
- **Evidence collection:** Proving what happened for financial reconciliation
- **Impact assessment:** Identifying all affected transactions

**Key Learning:** In microservices, **partial failures are more dangerous than complete failures** because they're harder to detect and can create data inconsistencies that require manual cleanup.

## 📋 Actual Test Execution Summary

**Test Date:** October 28, 2025 at 10:04 AM UTC  
**Environment:** kind cluster (sockshop) with Datadog agent  
**Payment Service Port:** 80 (NOT 8080)  
**Orders Service Port:** 80 (NOT 8080)  
**Datadog Service Tag:** `sock-shop-orders` (NOT `orders`)  

### Test Results

**Incident Duration:** ~10 minutes (10:04:00 - 10:14:00)

**Failed Orders Generated:** 4
1. Order ID: `6900953ac1f4320001b50703` - Total: $104.98 - Time: 10:04:42
2. Order ID: `69009558c1f4320001b50704` - Total: $19.99 - Time: 10:05:12
3. Order ID: `69009581c1f4320001b50705` - Total: $119.98 - Time: 10:05:53
4. Order ID: `69009589c1f4320001b50706` - Total: $104.98 - Time: 10:06:01

**Recovery Verified:** First successful order post-recovery
- Order ID: `69009776c1f4320001b50707` - Total: $18.99 - Time: 10:14:14
- Status progression: CREATED → PENDING → PAID → SHIPPED ✅

**Total Orders After Test:** 12 (4 failed + 8 successful)

### Key Discoveries

1. ✅ **Service Tags**: All services prefixed with `sock-shop-` in Datadog
2. ⚠️ **Log Parsing**: Datadog doesn't parse Spring Boot log levels (workaround: search by text)
3. ✅ **API Access**: Must use front-end pod for curl (orders pod lacks curl)
4. ⚠️ **UI Caching**: UI showed "Shipped" but database had "PAYMENT_FAILED" (cache issue)
5. ✅ **OrderStatus Lifecycle**: Correctly implemented with CREATED, PENDING, PAID, PAYMENT_FAILED, SHIPPED
6. ✅ **Error Handling**: Orders service properly catches payment failures and updates status
7. ✅ **Datadog Integration**: All logs successfully collected and searchable

### Lessons Learned

- **Always verify service tags** in Datadog facets before creating queries
- **Search by log content**, not parsed fields, when log pipelines aren't configured
- **Database is source of truth** - don't trust UI alone (verify via API)
- **Pod utilities matter** - know which pods have debugging tools (curl, etc.)
- **Port verification critical** - services may not run on expected ports
