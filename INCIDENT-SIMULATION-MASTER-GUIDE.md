## Purpose & Value

### Why These Incidents?

The Sock Shop application serves as a **production-like testbed** for evaluating SRE agent capabilities. These three incidents represent the most common and impactful failure scenarios in e-commerce microservices:

1. **Resource Exhaustion (Crash)** - Tests ability to detect and diagnose catastrophic failures
2. **Hybrid Incident (Front-end Crash + Backend Latency)** - Tests ability to differentiate service-level failures and identify architectural bottlenecks
3. **Distributed Transaction Failures (Inconsistency)** - Tests ability to trace complex multi-service issues

### Value for SRE Agent Development

| Capability | Incident 1 | Incident 2 | Incident 3 |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Log Analysis** | ✅ OOMKilled events | ✅ Connection timeouts, SIGTERM | ✅ Connection errors |
| **Metric Correlation** | ✅ CPU/Memory spikes | ✅ Selective restarts, latency | ✅ Service availability |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | ✅ Resource limits | ✅ Architectural bottleneck | ✅ Service dependencies |
| **Impact Assessment** | ✅ Total outage | ✅ Intermittent availability | ✅ Financial inconsistency |
| **Remediation Suggestions** | ✅ Scaling, limits | ✅ Front-end HPA, load balancing | ✅ Retry logic, circuit breakers |

### Demonstration Value

For stakeholders and customers, these incidents demonstrate:
- **Real-world relevance:** These exact scenarios happen in production
- **Complexity handling:** Multi-service, distributed systems challenges
- **Actionable insights:** Not just detection, but root cause and remediation
- **Business context:** Connecting technical issues to user/business impact

## Prerequisites

### Infrastructure Requirements

#### 1. Kubernetes Cluster (kind)
```powershell
# Verify cluster is running
kubectl cluster-info

# Expected Output:
# Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:xxxxx
```

#### 2. Sock Shop Application Deployed
```powershell
# Verify all pods running
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods

# Expected: All pods 1/1 READY, Running status
```

**⚠️ Important for Incident 3:** Orders service must be v1.0-status-fix version with `OrderStatus` lifecycle support
```powershell
# Verify orders service has status lifecycle support
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders --tail=20 | Select-String "status updated"

# Expected Output (shows status transitions):
# Order [id] status updated to CREATED
# Order [id] status updated to PENDING  
# Order [id] status updated to PAID
# (or PAYMENT_FAILED if payment fails)
```

#### 3. Datadog Agent Configured
```powershell
# Verify Datadog agent is collecting logs (select node agent, not cluster agent)
$POD = kubectl -n datadog get pods -o json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty items | Where-Object { $_.metadata.name -like "datadog-agent-*" -and $_.metadata.name -notlike "*cluster-agent*" } | Select-Object -First 1 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty metadata | Select-Object -ExpandProperty name

kubectl -n datadog exec $POD -c agent -- agent status | Select-String -Pattern "LogsProcessed"

# Expected: LogsProcessed: [non-zero number]
```

#### 4. Port Forwards Active
```powershell
# Start port forward if not running
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList 'kubectl -n sock-shop port-forward svc/front-end 2025:80'

## Incident Overview

### Incident 1: Application Crash via High Load

**File:** [INCIDENT-1-APP-CRASH.md](./INCIDENT-1-APP-CRASH.md)

**Summary:** Simulate extreme user load (3000+ concurrent users) causing resource exhaustion, pod crashes, and complete service unavailability.

**Key Characteristics:**
- User Load: 3000 concurrent users
- CPU Usage: 100% (throttled)
- Memory Usage: 100% (OOMKilled)
- Pod Restarts: Multiple
- User Impact: Complete outage (HTTP 500/503)
- Recovery: Automatic (Kubernetes self-healing)

**Datadog Evidence:**
- `OOMKilled` events
- `CrashLoopBackOff` status
- Connection refused errors
- Pod restart count increases

**Use Case:** Demonstrates SRE agent's ability to identify resource limits as root cause and suggest horizontal scaling.

---

### Incident 2: Application Latency via Moderate Load

**File:** [INCIDENT-2-APP-LATENCY.md](./INCIDENT-2-APP-LATENCY.md)

**Summary:** Simulate moderate user load (750 concurrent users) causing significant performance degradation. **HYBRID INCIDENT:** Front-end experiences crashes (5-10 restarts) while backend services remain stable with latency only.

**Key Characteristics:**
- User Load: 750 concurrent users
- Response Time: 9-13 seconds average (normal: <300ms)
- CPU Usage: 80-95% (high pressure)
- Memory Usage: 60-85% (pressure but stable)
- Pod Restarts: **Front-end: 5-10 restarts** | Backend: 0 (stays running)
- User Impact: Intermittent availability with severe slowness
- Recovery: Automatic (load drops)

**Datadog Evidence:**
- Connection timeout errors: 1,464 total
- Response times: 9-13 seconds average (20-25 seconds peak)
- Front-end pod restarts: 5-10 during test
- Backend services: No restarts, stable
- SIGTERM and connection refused errors (front-end crash logs)
- CPU throttling: Front-end at limits, backends moderate

**Use Case:** Demonstrates SRE agent's ability to detect subtle degradation and recommend performance optimizations before catastrophic failure.

---

### Incident 3: Payment Transaction Failure

**File:** [INCIDENT-3-PAYMENT-FAILURE.md](./INCIDENT-3-PAYMENT-FAILURE.md)

**⚠️ PREREQUISITE:** Requires v1.0-status-fix version of orders service with `OrderStatus` lifecycle support (`CREATED` → `PENDING` → `PAID`/`PAYMENT_FAILED`)

**Summary:** Simulate payment service failure during checkout, creating inconsistent transaction states (payment processed but order shows failed).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Trigger: Payment service scaled to 0 replicas
- Order Status Lifecycle: `CREATED` → `PENDING` → `PAYMENT_FAILED` (when payment service unavailable)
- Expected Failed Orders: ~4 (based on test execution with 10 users, 2 minutes)
- Payment Status: May be captured (real-world scenario)
- Pod Restarts: 0 (partial failure)
- User Impact: Financial inconsistency, trust damage
- Recovery: Manual (service restoration + reconciliation)

**Datadog Evidence:**
- "Connection refused" to payment service
- Orders marked as "PAYMENT_FAILED"
- Service availability = 0%
- Transaction ID inconsistencies

**Use Case:** Demonstrates SRE agent's ability to trace distributed transactions and identify data inconsistencies requiring manual remediation.

## Execution Workflow

### Recommended Execution Sequence

**For comprehensive SRE agent testing, execute in this order:**

#### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment (5 minutes)
```powershell
# 1. Verify environment
kubectl -n sock-shop get pods
kubectl top pods -n sock-shop
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:2025

# 2. Document baseline
# - All pods: 1/1 Running
# - CPU: 3-8m per pod
# - Memory: 50-200Mi per pod
# - Response time: 100-300ms

# 3. Open Datadog
# URL: https://us5.datadoghq.com/logs
# Query: kube_namespace:sock-shop
# Set to "Live Tail"
```

#### Phase 2: Execute Incident 1 - Crash (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Demonstrate catastrophic failure detection and recovery

```powershell
# Navigate to incident guide
cd d:\sock-shop-demo
code INCIDENT-1-APP-CRASH.md

# Execute steps from guide
# Key observation points:
# - Watch pods go from Running → CrashLoopBackOff
# - Monitor resource usage hitting 100%
# - Observe OOMKilled events
# - Verify application becomes unreachable
# - Watch Kubernetes self-healing (pod restarts)

# Recovery verification:
# - Pods return to Running
# - Resources return to baseline
# - Application accessible again
```

**SRE Agent Test Questions:**
1. "Why did the application crash at 10:23 AM?"
2. "How many pod restarts occurred during the incident?"
3. "What resource limits were exceeded?"
4. "How would you prevent this in production?"

#### Phase 3: Execute Incident 2 - Latency (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Demonstrate HYBRID incident - front-end crashes under load while backend services only experience latency

```powershell
# Navigate to incident guide
code INCIDENT-2-APP-LATENCY.md

# Execute steps from guide
# Key observation points:
# - Response times: 9-13 seconds average (severe degradation)
# - Front-end: 5-10 pod restarts during 8-minute test (connection exhaustion)
# - Backend services: 0 restarts, latency only (stable under filtered load)
# - Connection timeout errors: 1,464 total (front-end unable to accept connections)
# - CPU/Memory: Front-end at 80-95%; backends at 40-60%
# - Datadog shows connection timeouts and intermittent availability

# Recovery verification:
# - Response times normalize to <200ms
# - Resources drop to baseline
# - Front-end restart count increased by 5-10
# - Backend services: no new restarts
```

**SRE Agent Test Questions:**
1. "Users are complaining the site is slow and sometimes unavailable. What's happening?"
2. "Why are response times 9-13 seconds with frequent connection failures?"
3. "Why is front-end crashing but backend services stable?"
4. "What architectural bottleneck is causing this hybrid failure pattern?"
5. "What optimizations would prevent front-end crashes under this load?"

#### Phase 4: Execute Incident 3 - Payment Failure (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Demonstrate distributed transaction failure and data inconsistency

**⚠️ PREREQUISITE CHECK:**
```powershell
# Verify orders service has OrderStatus lifecycle support
kubectl -n sock-shop logs deployment/orders --tail=50 | Select-String "status updated"
# Should show: "Order [id] status updated to CREATED/PENDING/PAID/PAYMENT_FAILED"
```

```powershell
# Navigate to incident guide
code INCIDENT-3-PAYMENT-FAILURE.md

# Execute steps from guide
# Key observation points:
# - Payment service goes down (0 replicas)
# - Order status lifecycle: CREATED → PENDING → PAYMENT_FAILED
# - Orders created but marked "PAYMENT_FAILED" (expect ~4 failures)
# - No pod crashes (partial failure - different from Incidents 1 & 2)
# - Users see payment errors but orders ARE recorded in database
# - Datadog shows "Payment failed for order" logs with connection refused errors

# Recovery verification:
# - Payment service restored (scale to 1 replica)
# - New orders process successfully (CREATED → PENDING → PAID)
# - Query and count FAILED orders for remediation (expect 4)
# - Verify successful order shows full lifecycle with shipment
```

**SRE Agent Test Questions:**
1. "User says they were charged but no order confirmation. Investigate order ID: 68f35ed59c10d300018b7011"
2. "What caused payment failures between 11:20-11:30?"
3. "How many orders are in PAYMENT_FAILED status?"
4. "What should we do about failed transactions?"

#### Phase 5: SRE Agent Demonstration (30 minutes)

**Now use the collected data to test your SRE agent:**

1. **Log Analysis:** Point agent to Datadog, provide time ranges
2. **Root Cause ID:** Ask "What caused X incident?"
3. **Impact Assessment:** Ask "How many users were affected?"
4. **Remediation:** Ask "How do we prevent this?"
5. **Documentation:** Ask agent to create incident report

Type: Query Value
```

### Saved Datadog Queries

Create these saved views in Datadog Logs:

**View 1: "Incident 1 - Crash Events"**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop (OOMKilled OR CrashLoopBackOff OR "out of memory")
```

**View 2: "Incident 2 - HYBRID Incident (Front-end Crashes)"**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop (service:sock-shop-front-end AND ("Connection refused" OR SIGTERM OR "Connection timeout"))
```

**View 3: "Incident 3 - Payment Failures"**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop service:sock-shop-orders ("PAYMENT_FAILED" OR "Payment failed for order")
```

**View 4: "All Errors"**
```
kube_namespace:sock-shop status:error
```

## SRE Agent Testing Scenarios

### Testing Methodology

For each incident, test the SRE agent's ability to:

1. **Detect:** Identify that an incident is occurring
2. **Diagnose:** Determine root cause from logs/metrics
3. **Assess Impact:** Quantify user/business impact
4. **Remediate:** Suggest concrete fix actions
5. **Prevent:** Recommend architectural improvements

### Sample Agent Prompts

#### Incident 1 Testing Prompts

**Basic Detection:**
> "What happened to the Sock Shop application at [incident time]?"

**Expected Agent Response:**
- Detected pod crashes and restarts
- Identified OOMKilled events
- Found CPU/Memory at limits
- Concluded: Resource exhaustion under high load

**Root Cause Analysis:**
> "Why did front-end pod crash?"

**Expected Agent Response:**
- Memory limit: 1000Mi
- Peak usage: 1000Mi+ (exceeded)
- Contributing factor: 3000 concurrent users
- No horizontal scaling configured

**Remediation:**
> "How do we prevent this crash in production?"

**Expected Agent Response:**
1. Increase resource limits (+50%)
2. Implement HorizontalPodAutoscaler (2-10 replicas)
3. Add request rate limiting
4. Configure resource requests/limits appropriately

---

#### Incident 2 Testing Prompts

**Performance Investigation:**
> "Users are reporting the website is very slow and sometimes unavailable. Can you investigate?"

**Expected Agent Response:**
- Detected HYBRID incident pattern:
  - Front-end: 5-10 restarts (crashes due to connection exhaustion)
  - Backend services: 0 restarts (stable with latency only)
- Response times: 9-13 seconds average
- Connection timeout errors: 1,464 total
- CPU usage: Front-end 80-95% (throttled), Backend 40-60%
- Root cause: Front-end is architectural bottleneck
- Concluded: 750 concurrent users exceed front-end connection handling capacity

**Comparison Question:**
> "Is this the same issue as the crash we had earlier?"

**Expected Agent Response:**
- HYBRID incident - exhibits characteristics of both:
  - Incident 1 behavior (front-end): Connection exhaustion causing crashes/restarts
  - Incident 2 behavior (backend): Latency with stability
- Key difference: Front-end fails under 750 users while backends handle load
- Architectural insight: Front-end is single point of failure and bottleneck
- Implication: Scaling front-end horizontally would prevent crashes and improve backend load distribution

---

#### Incident 3 Testing Prompts

**Transaction Investigation:**
> "A customer says they were charged $29.99 but didn't receive order confirmation for order ID 6900953ac1f4320001b50703. Please investigate."

**Expected Agent Response:**
1. Queried Datadog logs: `kube_namespace:sock-shop "6900953ac1f4320001b50703"`
2. Found order lifecycle in logs:
   - T+0s: Order created with ID: 6900953ac1f4320001b50703, status: CREATED
   - T+0.01s: Order status updated to PENDING
   - T+0.01s: Sending payment request to http://payment/paymentAuth
   - T+2s: ERROR - Payment failed: Connection refused (Connection refused)
   - T+2.06s: WARN - Order status updated to PAYMENT_FAILED due to: Connection refused
3. Root cause: Payment service scaled to 0 replicas (unavailable during incident window)
4. Impact: Order recorded in database with PAYMENT_FAILED status but customer may have been charged
5. Recommendation: 
   - Verify with payment gateway if charge actually processed
   - Check payment service logs (if available) for transaction ID
   - If charged: Manually update order status to PAID in database and trigger fulfillment
   - If not charged: Notify customer of system issue, request re-order with discount
   - Review all orders with PAYMENT_FAILED status during incident window (expect 4 total)

**Architectural Improvement:**
> "How do we prevent payment failures from creating inconsistent states?"

**Expected Agent Response:**
1. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. Add circuit breaker to payment service calls
3. Use idempotency keys to prevent double charges
4. Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions
5. Add payment queue with dead letter queue (DLQ)
6. Daily reconciliation between orders and payment gateway

## Best Practices

### Before Running Incidents

1. **Coordinate with Team:**
   - Notify team members about testing
   - Don't run on production or shared environments
   - Schedule during low-activity periods

2. **Snapshot Current State:**
   ```powershell
   # Save current state
   kubectl -n sock-shop get all -o yaml > backup-pre-incident.yaml
   
   # Document resource usage
   kubectl top pods -n sock-shop > baseline-resources.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Monitoring:**
   - Confirm Datadog is collecting logs
   - Test Datadog query access
   - Ensure sufficient Datadog log retention

4. **Prepare Recovery Commands:**
   - Keep recovery commands ready
   - Have rollback plan documented
   - Test recovery in advance

### During Incident Execution

1. **Document Everything:**
   - Screenshot Datadog dashboards
   - Record timestamps of key events
   - Save Locust reports
   - Capture kubectl output

2. **Multiple Windows:**
   - Window 1: Pod monitoring (`kubectl get pods -w`)
   - Window 2: Resource monitoring (`kubectl top pods`)
   - Window 3: Log streaming (`kubectl logs -f`)
   - Window 4: Datadog browser

3. **Controlled Execution:**
   - Follow playbook step-by-step
   - Don't skip verification steps
   - Wait for expected outcomes before proceeding

### After Incident Completion

1. **Verify Complete Recovery:**
   ```powershell
   # All pods running
   kubectl -n sock-shop get pods
   
   # Resources normalized
   kubectl top pods -n sock-shop
   
   # Application accessible
   Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:2025
   ```

2. **Clean Up Resources:**
   ```powershell
   # Delete test jobs
   kubectl -n sock-shop delete job --all
   
   # Delete test configmaps
   kubectl -n sock-shop delete configmap -l app=locust
   ```

3. **Document Findings:**
   - What worked well?
   - What was unexpected?
   - How did SRE agent perform?
   - What improvements needed?

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Locust Job Fails to Start

**Symptoms:**
```
Error from server (NotFound): configmaps "locustfile-xxx" not found
```

**Cause:** ConfigMap not created or wrong namespace

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Verify ConfigMap exists
kubectl -n sock-shop get configmap

# If missing, reapply the YAML
kubectl apply -f locust-<incident>-test.yaml
```

---

#### Issue 2: Incident Not Creating Expected Impact

**Symptoms:** Application still responsive, no errors in logs

**Possible Causes:**
1. Load not high enough
2. Cluster has excess capacity
3. Resource limits too generous

**Solutions:**
```powershell
# Option 1: Increase load
# Edit YAML and increase USERS value

# Option 2: Reduce resource limits (temporary)
kubectl -n sock-shop set resources deployment front-end --limits=cpu=100m,memory=200Mi

# Remember to restore after testing!
```

---

#### Issue 3: Can't Access Datadog Logs

**Symptoms:** Datadog shows no logs or "No matching results"

**Cause:** Incorrect query or time range

**Solutions:**
1. Verify time range: Set to "Past 15 minutes"
2. Simplify query: Just use `kube_namespace:sock-shop`
3. Check agent status:
   ```powershell
   kubectl -n datadog get pods
   kubectl -n datadog logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=datadog-agent -c agent | Select-String "ERROR"
   ```

---

#### Issue 4: Application Won't Recover After Incident

**Symptoms:** Pods stuck in CrashLoopBackOff or Error state

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Force restart all deployments
kubectl -n sock-shop rollout restart deployment --all

# Wait for rollout
kubectl -n sock-shop rollout status deployment/front-end
kubectl -n sock-shop rollout status deployment/user
kubectl -n sock-shop rollout status deployment/orders

# If still failing, check events
kubectl -n sock-shop get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | Select -Last 20
```

---

#### Issue 5: Port Forward Drops During Testing

**Symptoms:** Can't access http://localhost:2025

**Cause:** Port forward process terminated

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Kill existing port forwards
$ports = 2025
(Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $ports -contains $_.LocalPort }).OwningProcess | Sort-Object -Unique | ForEach-Object { taskkill /PID $_ /F } 2>$null

# Restart port forward
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList 'kubectl -n sock-shop port-forward svc/front-end 2025:80'
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

# Verify
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:2025
```
